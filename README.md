### Purpose
This document presents the C++11 port of the original `libtra` C89 library, designed to reduce number of points without losing informations about tracks and roads.
The purpose of the algorithm is, given a curve composed of line segments, to find a similar curve with fewer points. The algorithm defines 'dissimilar' based on the maximum distance between the original curve and the simplified curve. The simplified curve consists of a subset of the points that defined the original curve.

### Details
The library has to be deployed as a submodule for the repositories that need using it.
